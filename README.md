# Dynamic Scaling of Neural Networks

This repository explores the fundamental concepts and empirical studies of scaling neural networks during training, with a specific focus on understanding how model architectures can be expanded while maintaining their learned representations and performance characteristics.

## Overview

This research investigates the relationship between different-sized neural networks and their training dynamics, particularly examining:

1. How to properly scale up model architectures
2. The role of forward and backward kernels in network behavior
3. Methods for maintaining model equivalence during scaling
4. Empirical validation of scaling theories
